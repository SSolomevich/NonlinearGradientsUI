To build a fat jar in Netbeans including all the libraries needed to run the 
GradientOptimizer GUI I have followed the steps explain at 

http://arunasujith.blogspot.se/2011/08/how-to-build-fat-jar-using-netbeans.html

The basic idea is to modify the build.xml such that a new target is included. 

Since the build.xml is already modified now, if you want to build a fatjar
in Netbeans you need to follow the following steps:

1. Open the project in Netbeans 

2. Right-click on the project name and select Clean and Build 

3. Right-click on build.xml (Select the Files tab instead of Projects to see the file), select Run Target->Other targets->package-for-store

4. The fatjar will be: store/GradientOptimizer.jar
